# Praxis

Development workflow skills for Claude Code — disciplined, fast, resilient.

Each skill is an orchestrator with pluggable steps. External integrations (issue tracker, PR tool, code review) are routed via the project's CLAUDE.md — no hardcoded dependencies.

## Prerequisites

| Tier | What works | Dependencies |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Standalone** | turbo-setup, recover-sessions | `gh` CLI |
| **Enhanced** | + turbo-implement, turbo-completion, debug, retrospect | + oh-my-claudecode |
| **Full** | + all cmux-* skills | + cmux |

## Skills (12)

### Workflow Lifecycle

| Skill | Purpose | Pluggable Steps |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `turbo-setup` | Compound setup — issue + plan + branch + worktree + deps in one pass | issue creation, planning |
| `turbo-implement` | Implementation orchestrator — selects execution mode and chains to delivery | ralph, autopilot (pluggable) |
| `turbo-completion` | Compound completion — verify + review + PR + merge + cleanup (--verify-only for standalone verification) | code review, PR creation |

### Development

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `debug` | Systematic 4-phase debugging — root cause investigation before any fix |
| `retrospect` | Session retrospect — find friction root causes, propose improvements |

### Session Management

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cmux-save-sessions` | Save cmux session list as JSON snapshot |
| `cmux-resume-sessions` | Restore cmux workspaces from JSON snapshot |
| `cmux-recover-sessions` | Bulk recover sessions after crash (cmux backend) |
| `recover-sessions` | Bulk recover sessions after power loss (tmux backend) |
| `cmux-session-manager` | Daily session lifecycle — status dashboard, cleanup, reorganize |
| `cmux-delegate` | Delegate a task to an independent session with auto-collected context |
| `cmux-orchestrator` | Dispatch and supervise parallel Claude Code workers in cmux |

**Pluggable** = delegated to project's CLAUDE.md routing. Default: `gh` CLI.
**Built-in** = git operations, universal across all projects.

## Design Principles

- **Orchestrator + pluggable steps**: turbo-* stay as single skills, each step is swappable via CLAUDE.md routing
- **CLAUDE.md is the interface**: no config files — project instructions define routing
- **SRP per skill**: each skill has one responsibility, chaining connects them
- **Discipline over convenience**: Iron Laws gate each phase, no skipping

## Local Development

### Canonical clone path

This repository should live at **`~/projects/praxis`**. The CLI tools shipped
by skills (e.g. `cmux-recover-sessions`, `claude-recover`, `cmux-save-sessions`)
are symlinked from `~/.local/bin` into this clone, so patches you commit here
land in the version that actually runs at the shell. Keeping a second clone
under a legacy name risks `~/.local/bin` symlinks pointing at stale code —
a real failure mode previously hit during recover-sessions debugging.

### Install / refresh CLI symlinks

```bash
# From inside this clone:
./scripts/install.sh
```

Idempotent. Existing valid links are left alone; missing or drifted ones
are corrected. Re-run after pulls or after adding a new CLI script.

### Verify symlinks point at this clone

```bash
./scripts/verify-symlinks.sh
```

Exits non-zero on drift, so it can be wired into CI or a SessionStart hook
to catch "patch landed in the wrong clone" before it bites a future session.
